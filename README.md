# JS Pulsarcast

A JS implementation of [Pulsarcast](https://github.com/JGAntunes/pulsarcast)

**Keep in mind that this module is still under heavy constructoin :hammer:**

## Install

```
npm install pulsarcast
```

## Usage

:hammer: WIP :hammer:

## API

:hammer: WIP :hammer:

## Notes

Currently we're still relying on a couple of forks from `libp2p`/`ipfs` projects. Hence a lot of the git dependencies in the `package.json`, specifically `kad-dht` and `js-libp2p`. The long term plan of course is to either merge the changes upstream or find alternative methods for our needs.

**Browser support** is still no guaranteed. All of the testing and development is currently being done on NodeJS only, although the plan is to have this done for the browser also :+1:
